I am a research scientist at Riverside Research working in the Applied Mathematics and Physics Solutions group. Previously, I was a postdoc at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the Data Analysis and Machine Learning group working on machine learning techniques for dynamical systems. I earned my Ph. D. at the University of Florida in 2016 working with Dr. Scott McCullough on modeling tuples of 3-isometries as sub-Jordan operator tuples.
